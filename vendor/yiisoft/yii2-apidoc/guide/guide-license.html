            <p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>

            <p> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
            <ol>
                <li>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
                    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
                    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
                    this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
                    Each licensee is addressed as "you".
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p> A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
                prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
                (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>

            <p> The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
                which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
                Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
                copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
                portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
                straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
                included without limitation in the term "modification".)</p>

            <p> "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
                making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
                all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
                interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
                and installation of the library.</p>

            <p> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
                covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
                running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
                such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
                on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
                writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
                and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
                    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
                    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
                    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
                    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
                    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
                    Library.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
                and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
                fee.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
                    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
                    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
                    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
                </li>
            </ol>
<pre><code>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)
</code></pre>
            <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
                identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
                and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
                themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
                sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
                distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
                on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
                this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
                entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
                it.</p>

            <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
                your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
                exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
                collective works based on the Library.</p>

            <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
                with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
                a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
                the scope of this License.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
                    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
                    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
                    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
                    instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
                    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
                    that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
                    these notices.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p> Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
                that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
                subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>

            <p> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
                the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
                    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
                    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
                    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
                    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
                    medium customarily used for software interchange.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
                from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
                source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
                distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
                compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
                    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
                    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
                    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
                    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p> However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
                creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
                contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
                library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
                Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>

            <p> When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
                that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
                derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
                Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
                linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
                threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>

            <p> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
                structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
                functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
                file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
                work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
                Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>

            <p> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
                distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
                Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
                whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
                    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
                    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
                    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
                    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
                    engineering for debugging such modifications.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
                Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
                this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
                during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
                copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
                directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
                of these things:</p>
<pre><code>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</code></pre>
            <p> For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
                Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
                reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
                the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
                normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
                components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
                which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
                the executable.</p>

            <p> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
                restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
                accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
                use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
                distribute.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
                    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
                    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
                    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
                    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
                    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
                </li>
            </ol>
<pre><code>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</code></pre>
            <ol>
                <li><p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
                    the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
                    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
                    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
                    rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
                    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
                    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
                    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
                    distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
                    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
                    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
                    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
                    the Library or works based on it.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
                    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
                    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
                    subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
                    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
                    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
                    this License.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
                    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
                    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
                    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
                    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
                    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
                    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
                    may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
                    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
                    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
                    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
                    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>

                implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
                generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
                through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
                system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
                to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
                impose that choice.</p>

            <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
                be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
                    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
                    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
                    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
                    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
                    excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
                    written in the body of this License.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
                    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
                    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
                    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
                specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
                "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
                conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
                the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
                license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
                the Free Software Foundation.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
                    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
                    write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
                    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
                    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
                    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
                    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
                    and reuse of software generally.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>NO WARRANTY</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
                    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
                    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY

                    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
                    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
                    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
                    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
                    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
                    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE

                    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
                    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
